# Here is some UI and work shown in this repository.
#
## Login to this repository with the user's email and password. If the login is successful, the transaction dashboard will show in front of the user. If the user deposits an amount, that amount deposit div will show and will be added to the total balance. If the user withdraws the amount, that amount will be shown in the withdraw div and the withdraw amount will be deducted from the total balance. Here some common event handlers are written in a function and used again and again.
